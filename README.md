# HumanizedAI
This project aims to develop an AI capable of personality, emotions, and much more. The goal is for the AI to learn and interact like a "human." One key feature will be an adjustable filter, allowing the AI to engage in humorous (including dark humor) and entertaining conversations.
Primarily designed for use in streams, the AI will utilize a Speech-to-Text (STT) - Processing - Text-to-Speech (TTS) system and will be able to differentiate between various voices.

By the way. You can always comment in german because I'm a actually from Austria.
